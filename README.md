# Simple File Control

A simple file utility that I have been using privately for some private projects.

I decided to try and publish a NuGet package. To my dismay I discovered the project https://github.com/visualeyes/cabinet . It is more developed, larger community, more store implementations and has a cooler name.

I decided to launch this anyways just because, but if you are looking for something more mature I would pass you off to them.

Some things I will hopefully get around to doing:

- More Store implementations such as DB Blob, AWS, network store, etc
- Unit tests
- Versioning of files
